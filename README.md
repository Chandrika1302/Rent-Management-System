# Client Side Structure:

Motivation for the client side structure comes from this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUga4-z7b6s). This structure can be found [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-folder-structure/tree/main/advanced/src). The only reason this structure is being followed so religiously is to save the sanity of the developers.

# API Side Structure

Most of the structure has been generated by the express-generator package:
`npx express-generator --no-view api`

# Other Recommended stuff

1. Use Linux - makes a lot of things easier.
2. Have the latest version of nodeJS and npm installed on your system.
