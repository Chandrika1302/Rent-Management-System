# Client Side Structure:

Motivation for the client side structure comes from this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUga4-z7b6s). This structure can be found [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-folder-structure/tree/main/advanced/src).

# API Side Structure

Most of the structure has been generated by the express-generator package:

```
npx express-generator --no-view api
```

an example of .env is also provided under ./api, a copy of this file on google drive for colloboration purposes can be requested from me [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ny_Jq6myp8s3SlVCL-o-VN5xPc1M1ZvV/view?usp=share_link). This has not been put in the github repository for obvious security reasons.

- API specs are located in api/api-specs.xlsx

- Format of all errors from server:

```
{
   "code":"code"
   "message":"message"
}
```

## API entities:

- user: The logged in user or owner of the PG

- room: A room contains references to tenants and transactions

- tenant: A tenant "occupies" a room and contains information like phone number, aadhar card etc.

- transaction: A money transfer, transactions are bound to rooms and not to users. A positive balance: The tenant has to pay the PG owner.

# Other Recommended Stuff

1. Linux - So you don't face nodemon and other stupid windows errors.

2. Latest npm and lts version of node: To ensure stuff doesn't break due to strange version errors.
