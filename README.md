abiltity to host a full stack express app. Much love to them for this wonderful service :D

# Client Side Structure:

Motivation for the client side structure comes from this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUga4-z7b6s). This structure can be found [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-folder-structure/tree/main/advanced/src). The only reason this structure is being followed so religiously is to save the sanity of the developers.

# API Side Structure

Most of the structure has been generated by the express-generator package:

```
npx express-generator --no-view api
```

an example of .env is also provided under ./api, a copy of this file on google drive for colloboration purposes can be requested from me [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ny_Jq6myp8s3SlVCL-o-VN5xPc1M1ZvV/view?usp=share_link). This has not been put in the github repository for obvious security reasons.

# Other Recommended stuff

1. Use Linux - makes a lot of things easier.
2. Have the latest version of nodeJS and npm installed on your system.
